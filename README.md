# Crypt ðŸ’° 
A new cryptocurrency powered by NodeJS

## The project ðŸ“š

Pocket is a new cryptocurrency create by **GonÃ§alo Souto** (github.com/souto2001).

The main goal with pocket is to be easy to implement on various websites or applications that need a secure transaction, making a "face to face battle" again Bitcoin or Ethereum, the current giants in the field of cryptocurrency.

## Status ðŸ“ˆ

Right now *"Crypt"* is not 100% functional.

## Value ðŸ’¶

Right now Pocket hasn't any value at all, as it is just in testing.
